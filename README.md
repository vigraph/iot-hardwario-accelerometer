# iot-hardwario-accelerometer

Firmware for the Hardwario Core Module which publishes discrete accelerometer values for [ViGraph](http://www.vigraph.com)

Loosely based on Hardwario/BigClown's example https://github.com/bigclownlabs/bcf-radio-push-button and uses their SDK (see sdk submodule).  See how to build it at https://developers.hardwario.com/firmware/toolchain-setup
